# Pallete Creator

This project is a palette creator tool that allows users to generate and
customize color palettes for their design projects. It provides an intuitive
interface for selecting colors, adjusting their properties, and saving the
palettes for future use. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and
accessible, making it easy for designers of all skill levels to create beautiful
and cohesive color schemes.

## Instructions

First generate a main color by using the inputs or the random button. The slots
will appear and variations will be generated based on color theory.

When you change the main slot, everything else resets and new variations are
added. You can click on the variations to select the color, then click on one of
the palette slots to paste it.

Or press the random scheme button to generate a new scheme from the variations.
Then the colors can be adjusted using the sliders.

You can then save the scheme (sign in first) or export the css, test the scheme
on the page, change color names, test dark and light text, etc...
